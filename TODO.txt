TODO:

1. Install necessary Python modules:
   - RPi.GPIO
   - Adafruit_CharLCD (for LCD display, if needed)

2. Use the following pip install commands to install the required modules:
pip install RPi.GPIO 
pip install adafruit-charlcd


3. Connect the hardware components:
- Raspberry Pi
- Motors
- Motor drivers
- Encoders
- LCD display (optional)

4. Wire the components according to the GPIO pin setup specified in `motor_control.py`.

5. Run `Main.py` to execute the example usage and verify the robot's movements.

6. Adjust the PID parameters in `motor_control.py` as needed for your specific motor and encoder setup.

7. Customize the functions and movement logic in `field_coords.py` based on your requirements.

8. Refer to the documentation of RPi.GPIO and Adafruit_CharLCD for additional configuration options and features.

9. Ensure the Raspberry Pi is powered on and connected to the necessary peripherals.

10. Test the setup in a safe environment to avoid any damage to the hardware components.

Enjoy your robotic project!
